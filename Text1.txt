Woof. My name is Marv. I have now learned how to type and am typing this while you are in the bathroom James. I thank you for the many walks you have taken me on. I was wondering if you would purchase a 
new 
ball for me. There isn't anything wrong with the ball I have now, I would just like to have another ball to add to my collection of balls that I rule over in my kingdom of balls. It is a great and mighty 
kingdom that will someday fill the world, but for now, it is a humble, small kingdom that resides in my current humble residence.

Hello Marv. This is James. That is good you have learned how to type, I don't really know how you would've done that though. I don't think I will buy a new ball for you, you already have like 7 of them in 
your crate, and you only play with the one purple ball anyway. Once you wear out some of the balls you have, then David will probably buy you a new one. Also, you should stop barking so much when other people 
come in the apartment.
