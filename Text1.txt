Woof. My name is Marv. I have now learned how to type and am typing this while you are in the bathroom James. I thank you for the many walks you have taken me on. I was wondering if you would purchase a new 
ball for me. There isn't anything wrong with the ball I have now, I would just like to have another ball to add to my collection of balls that I rule over in my kingdom of balls. It is a great and mighty 
kingdom that will someday fill the world, but for now, it is a humble, small kingdom that resides in my current humble residence.
